# Gen-AI MongoDB Query System using Offline LLM

This project is a Gen-AI assignment that demonstrates how to build an automated data query and retrieval system using:
- An offline LLM (CodeLLaMA)
- MongoDB
- Python
- CSV file data

It allows natural language questions about CSV data to be dynamically converted into MongoDB queries, executed, and either displayed or saved.
